  CLASS
    CRedfearn

    When using this class, you must instantiate it with an instance of the ellipsoid 
    and map grid.

    Redfearn's formulae were published in the "Empire Survey Review", No. 69, 1948. 
    They may be used to  convert between latitude & longitude and easting, 
    northing & zone for a Transverse Mercator projection, such as the Map
    Grid of Australia (MGA). These formulae are accurate to better than 
    1 mm in any zone of  the Map Grid of Australia and for the purposes 
    of definition may be regarded as exact. 
    See "Geocentric Datum of Australia, Technical Manual" Version 2.2 for 
    the algorithms. Avaiable from http://www.icsm.gov.au/icsm/gda/gdatm/index.html 
    as a pdf file.
